An Ember CLI addon. Allows to combine `{{link-to}}` helper with firing an action.

It is useful when you want to fire an action at the same time when user transitions to other route by clicking `{{link-to}}`. **It is OK for SEO solution.**

# Usage

You can pass closure action as `invokeAction` attribute of `{{link-to}}` component:

``` hbs
{{#link-to 'other-route' invokeAction=(action 'testAction')}}
  Link to other route
{{/link-to}}
```

You can also use string name instead of closure action:

``` hbs
{{#link-to 'other-route' invokeAction='testAction'}}
  Link to other route
{{/link-to}}
```

To pass parameters to action you can use:

``` hbs
{{#link-to 'other-route' invokeAction=(action 'testAction' param1 param2)}}
  Link to other route
{{/link-to}}
```

# Compatibility

Addon works with `>= 2.0` versions of Ember. Tests confirm that it works as expected with release, beta and canary.
